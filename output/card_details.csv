Testcontainers,"https://www.testcontainers.org/

This, as the name suggests, is a library that provides disposable Docker containers for tests. The idea is to be able to start them from code. It provides out of the box support (classes) for a few popular data stores, or you can spin up your own from an image and set it up the way you like. You can also load your setup from docker-compose files.

It doesn't even compose locally, as it apparently spins up a docker compose container that composes things internally, so the only requirement is Docker.
